About Anthropic
Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

At Anthropic, we believe new AI capabilities are best achieved through secure foundations, not in spite of them. As capabilities grow more advanced, it is critical that progress moves forward safely and for the benefit of all society. It is the reason why security sits at the center of our work, and not as an afterthought. 

We're specifically looking for a Software Engineer to help us build and maintain new agentic coding tools for developers. The ideal candidate will have a passion for developer tools, extensive knowledge of diverse programming environments and languages, and experience with advanced LLM features like tool-use, chaining and orchestration patterns, and prompt engineering. Curiosity about AI research is a must!

Responsibilities:
Design, build, and maintain scalable features and infrastructure for AI-powered development tools
Engage directly with developers inside and outside Anthropic to gather insights and improve user experience
Collaborate with researchers to improve model capabilities through shared tools and evals
Stay ahead of advancements in AI-assisted coding by experimenting with new tools, evaluating emerging techniques, and tracking enhancements to existing ones
Contribute across the stack—from front-end UI to back-end infrastructure—to develop new features, fix bugs, and optimize performance
Dive into possibly unfamiliar areas like Python notebooks, VS Code plug-ins, and containerized environments.
You may be a good fit if you:
Are excited about AI-assisted coding as a tool to enhance developer productivity and creativity—not replace human ingenuity
Spend a lot of time refining and customizing your AI workflows
Have experience building and maintaining dev tools
Are an expert in React development, including performance optimization, modern patterns (hooks, context, suspense), and component architecture
Specialize in user experience engineering but are a capable full stack developer
Have hands-on experience working with large language models and prompt engineering
Have worked on projects with stringent safety, security and/or compliance requirements
Care about the societal impacts and ethics of your work
Strong candidates may also have experience with:
Building and maintaining CLI tools
Working in large codebases and quickly jumping in to unfamiliar development environments
Working with container orchestration and cloud infrastructure
Scaling TypeScript projects
Working with alternate JavaScript runtimes like Bun and Deno
The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$320,000 - $560,000 USD

Logistics
Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
