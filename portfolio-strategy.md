# Portfolio Website Strategy for Anthropic Application

## Current Situation
- Applying for: **Software Engineer, Claude Code** at Anthropic ($320k-560k)
- Current positioning: Data analyst who codes on the side
- Needed positioning: **Self-Taught Full-Stack Developer & AI Engineer**

## Portfolio Goals

### Primary Objective
Demonstrate you can build production-grade AI systems and developer tools - exactly what the Claude Code team needs.

### Key Messages to Convey
1. **"I build AI systems that work in production"** - Not just experiments or tutorials
2. **"I solve real problems with code"** - Every project addresses actual pain points
3. **"I think about developer experience"** - Your tools are built for humans to use
4. **"I can ship independently"** - 4+ years of solo development proves autonomy

## Must-Have Projects to Showcase

### 1. Knowledge Graph MCP System (HERO PROJECT)
**Why it matters:** Directly relevant to Claude Code's mission of AI-assisted development
- Emphasize: Production deployment, 85-second processing, $0.00002 cost
- Include: Architecture diagram, performance metrics, demo video
- Link to: GitHub repo with comprehensive README
- Frame as: "AI memory system for persistent context"

### 2. Admin Dashboard (Full-Stack Proof)
**Why it matters:** Shows you build complete, usable applications
- Emphasize: React + Python, real users (your team), solves workflow problems
- Include: Screenshots (sanitized), tech stack, problem it solved
- Frame as: "Internal tools platform serving entire operations team"

### 3. Multi-Agent Note System (Vision Project)
**Why it matters:** Shows forward-thinking about AI agent orchestration
- Emphasize: Complex agent coordination, personal knowledge management
- Include: Concept explanation, architecture plans
- Frame as: "Next-generation AI workflow orchestration"

### 4. Masakali Payment Integration (Production Experience)
**Why it matters:** Proves you handle real money and business requirements
- Emphasize: Stripe integration, production deployment, real transactions
- Include: Tech stack, security considerations
- Frame as: "Full-stack payment processing system"

## Design & Presentation Strategy

### Visual Design Priorities
1. **Clean and technical** - Not flashy, focus on clarity
2. **Performance metrics prominent** - Numbers build credibility
3. **Code snippets** - Show actual implementation quality
4. **Architecture diagrams** - Demonstrate systems thinking

### Content Structure
```
Hero Section:
"Full-Stack Developer & AI Engineer
Building production AI systems that solve real problems"
[Featured Project: Knowledge Graph MCP]

Projects Section:
- Each project gets: Problem | Solution | Impact | Tech Stack
- Metrics prominently displayed
- Links to GitHub and live demos

About Section:
- Brief journey from self-taught to production systems
- Focus on problem-solving mindset
- Mention building tools when existing ones don't work

Skills Section:
- Grouped by category: AI/ML, Backend, Frontend, DevOps
- Emphasize production experience
```

### Technical Credibility Elements
- **Performance metrics** on every project
- **GitHub activity graph** showing consistent commits
- **Tech stack badges** showing modern tool usage
- **Architecture diagrams** proving systems thinking
- **Demo videos** showing working systems

## What to Remove/Downplay
- Any mention of "learning" or "practicing"
- Projects that look like tutorials or exercises
- Apologetic language ("my first attempt", "still learning")
- Non-technical work unless it shows impact

## Anthropic-Specific Optimizations

### Keywords to Include
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Knowledge graphs
- Semantic extraction
- Developer tools
- AI-assisted development
- Production systems
- Performance optimization
- Full-stack development

### Cultural Alignment to Show
- Human-centered AI design
- Building tools that adapt to how people think
- Focus on practical, working solutions
- Interest in AI safety and reliability

## Quick Wins (Do These First)

1. **Update hero text** to position as AI engineer (5 min)
2. **Add Knowledge Graph MCP** as featured project (15 min)
3. **Add performance metrics** to all projects (10 min)
4. **Update GitHub links** to point to cleaned-up repos (5 min)
5. **Remove or reframe** any "learning project" language (10 min)

## Success Metrics
Your portfolio works if a visitor thinks:
- "This person ships production code"
- "They understand AI systems deeply"
- "They'd be great for developer tools"
- "They solve real problems, not toy examples"

## Remember
The portfolio isn't about showing you're learning - it's about proving you're already building what Anthropic needs. You have the projects. Now frame them with the confidence they deserve.

Every project you've built is portfolio-worthy when positioned correctly. The Knowledge Graph MCP alone demonstrates senior-level thinking. Your "messy" admin dashboard is a production system serving real users. Own it.
