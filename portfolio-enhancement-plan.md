# Portfolio Projects Homepage Enhancement Plan

Changes should be made to the projects section of the homepage located in @src/app/page.tsx


## Architecture Documentation Planning

### Implementation Guide for Architecture Documentation
**Location**: Update `src/lib/projects.ts` with two new fields:
1. `longDescription`: 2-3 sentences highlighting the key technical achievement and business impact
2. `architecture`: Technical deep-dive with **bold section headers** for readability

**Writing Style Guidelines**:
- Avoid repetition - each point should add new information
- Focus on outcomes and measurable improvements (e.g., "20min → 5min" not just "faster")
- Use concrete metrics over vague claims (e.g., "8yr historical data" not "$MM+ tracked")
- Keep technical but readable - hiring managers should understand the impact
- Structure: Problem → Solution → Result

**Recommended Architecture Sections**:
- **Data Pipeline**: Input → Processing → Output flow
- **Performance Wins**: Specific optimizations with before/after metrics
- **Infrastructure Innovation**: Unique architectural decisions and why they matter
- **Cost Optimization**: Quantifiable savings or efficiency gains
