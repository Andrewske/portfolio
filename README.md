## üíº Featured Projects

### Knowledge Graph MCP
AI knowledge graph system for processing personal documents into context for AI agents. Built on AutoSchemaKG framework - I extended the original with emotional context extraction because AI agents need to understand personal patterns. Achieved 68% per-token improvement (64ms‚Üí21ms) with 70% cost reduction through parallel processing optimization.

### AI Product Optimizer
Prompt engineering experiments for automated e-commerce title generation at scale. Systematic evaluation of 6 LLMs across 6 processing approaches. Discovered cost-performance sweet spot with GPT-4o-mini achieving 90% cost reduction through OpenAI Batch API.

### Analytics Platform
Executive analytics platform processing 160M+ order records with static Parquet architecture. Turns out static files load faster than any API - eliminated infrastructure costs while achieving sub-second dashboard loads. Processes $143M GMV across 48k+ sellers with 75% performance gains.

### Zoho Twilio Integration
Production SMS system allowing 12 studios to text leads directly from Zoho CRM. Multi-tenant architecture with database sync that fixed duplicate record creation. Shipped complete SaaS solution in 4 weeks as sole engineer.

### Masakali Booking Platform
Vacation rental booking system managing 5 properties with cross-villa blocking. Webhook-based architecture preventing double-bookings of shared physical space through automated Smoobu API integration. Generated $30k+ revenue with zero booking conflicts.

### Personal Management System
Custom AI tools for ADHD workflow management using specialized Claude Code agents. Couldn't find existing tools that fit how my brain works, so I built separate domain-specific agents for career coaching, project management, and personal productivity. Telegram bot automation with GitHub sync for daily documentation.

### Music Minion CLI
Context-aware music rating system built in one day for CLI development experience. Features temporal preference tracking and mood pattern analysis designed for future AI integration.
