# AI Learnings

## About the User
**Technical Background**: Full-stack engineer (2020-2025), sole developer across all projects, production systems experience (160M+ records, $30k+ revenue, 43k+ messages), AI/ML expertise, Next.js/TypeScript/PostgreSQL stack

**Work Philosophy**: Performance/cost optimization focus, measurable business outcomes, data-driven architecture decisions

## Communication Preferences
**Style**: Direct and concise, prefers consultation over assumptions, wants control over decisions
**Feedback**: Wants progress visibility, appreciates multiple options with trade-offs explained
**Planning**: Values structured approach with todo tracking, systematic implementation phases

## Work Style & Implementation Approach
**Planning**: Ask clarifying questions first, systematic approaches, structured implementation phases
**Decision Making**: Data-driven, wants to understand trade-offs before proceeding
**Safety Philosophy**: Scale-appropriate safety (robust validation for production, manual review for experimental)
**Engineering**: Practical constraints-aware (read-only DB → creative optimization, cost monitoring for AI)

## Stated Goals
**Career Target**: Top-tier AI roles (specifically mentioned Anthropic application prep)
**Portfolio Goal**: Compelling showcase for hiring managers, homepage-level focus on AI evaluation and performance
**Enhancement Strategy**: Following systematic enhancement plan, structured documentation phases

## Personal Context
**ADHD**: Explicitly mentioned struggles with eating/food preparation in context of diet planning agent
**Financial Management**: Acknowledged "struggles with money" for budget analysis agent
**Personal Projects**: Uses specialized AI agents for different life domains (career, finance, health, project management)

## Portfolio Projects - Detailed Context

### AIProductOptimizer (July 2025 - ongoing)
**Real Performance Data**: Tested 6 LLM models (gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-5-nano-flex)
**Cost Analysis**: $0.00003 to $0.00175 per item, found GPT-5 models too expensive despite 95% accuracy
**Experimental Approaches**: iterative, async progressive, tool-calling, batch-processing, batch-api, early-async
**Current Status**: "Actually never found a solution that I really liked. The cost/time was just too much"
**New Approach**: Working on template-based solution with brand mapping, term extraction, accuracy checking
**Architecture**: Breaking products into brands, creating term maps, template builder approach

### KnowledgeGraphMCP (June 2025 - ongoing)
**Optimization Strategy**: Cost/speed focus using gpt-4o-mini, parallel calls, reduced input tokens
**Real Metrics**: 94.4s processing, 8668 characters, $0.0012 cost, 20 triples, 80 vectors, 0 concepts
**Current Issue**: Concept generation stage not working, needs debugging
**Approach**: "I just start with gpt-4o-mini for cost/speed reasons. I haven't had the chance to try different models"

### PersonalManagementSystem (June 2025 - ongoing)
**Unique Architecture**: Using Claude Code (Opus/Sonnet) with persistent file-based context
**Specialized Agents**:
  - Career Coach (Anthropic application prep)
  - Bonanza Project Manager (prioritization)
  - Budget Analyst (CSV transaction analysis, money struggles context)
  - Diet/Meal Planner (ADHD-aware nutrition, food preparation struggles)
**Philosophy**: "Context-aware AI agents providing personalized guidance" across life domains
**Innovation**: File-based agent specialization vs traditional model fine-tuning

## Architecture & Safety Philosophy
**Scale-appropriate safety**: Production systems use robust validation (Smoobu booking prevention, multi-tenant auth), experimental projects use manual review

**Practical engineering**: Read-only DB constraints → creative optimization, cost monitoring for AI projects, manual processes for dev/experimental

**Implementation style**: Ask clarifying questions first, systematic approaches, data-driven architecture, separation of concerns

## Portfolio Structure & Enhancement Strategy
**Current setup**: 6 projects (2020-2025), 3 with detail pages, terminal styling theme
**Role Pattern**: "Sole developer" across all projects, 5+ years timeline span
**Enhancement Goal**: AI evaluation documentation for hiring managers, systematic portfolio enhancement plan
**Documentation Priority**: Executive summary style showing decision-making and technical judgment
