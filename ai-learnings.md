# AI Learnings

## User Profile
**Technical**: Full-stack engineer (2020-2025), sole developer, production systems (160M+ records, $30k+ revenue, 43k+ messages), AI/ML expertise, Next.js/TypeScript/PostgreSQL

**Work Style**: Structured planning, todo tracking, ask before implementing, wants control over decisions

**Communication**: Direct style, prefers consultation over assumptions, wants progress visibility and multiple options

## Portfolio Projects
**AnalyticsPlatform** (Aug 2023): 160M+ records, MySQL 5.7 → Polars optimization (10min → 5min), 13 views
**MasakaliBookingPlatform** (July 2020): $30K revenue, zero double-bookings, Booking.com/Airbnb sync
**ZohoTwilioIntegration** (Nov 2023): 43K+ messages, 9K leads, multi-tenant SMS, 4-week delivery
**AIProductOptimizer** (July 2025): 4.5K titles/30min, $0.00003/listing, OpenAI batch API
**KnowledgeGraphMCP** (June 2025): 3-stage pipeline, $0.00002/doc, 106 triples + 424 embeddings
**PersonalManagementSystem** (June 2025): AI agent ecosystem, domain-specific agents, Claude Code

**Patterns**: Sole developer, production systems, performance/cost optimization, TypeScript/Next.js/PostgreSQL, measurable business outcomes

## Architecture & Safety Philosophy
**Scale-appropriate safety**: Production systems use robust validation (Smoobu booking prevention, multi-tenant auth), experimental projects use manual review

**Practical engineering**: Read-only DB constraints → creative optimization, cost monitoring for AI projects, manual processes for dev/experimental

**Implementation style**: Ask clarifying questions first, systematic approaches, data-driven architecture, separation of concerns

## Portfolio Structure
**Current setup**: 6 projects (2020-2025), 3 with detail pages (`/admin-dashboard`, `/masakali`, `/zoho-twilio`), data in `src/lib/projects.ts`, ProjectCard component with terminal styling

**Role**: "Sole developer" across all projects, 5+ years timeline, scope: architecture, backend optimization, AI/ML pipelines, full-stack, payment/API integration, cost optimization

**Enhancement goal**: Top-tier AI roles, following systematic enhancement plan, compelling subtitles + business impact, homepage-level focus, structured implementation phases
